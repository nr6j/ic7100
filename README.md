Control Head Emultator for Icom IC7100

This project is for connecting a computer to the IC7100 radio instead of using its control head.

This ic7100 program shows Icons that are similar to the icons on the 7100 control head, in a similar layout, in order to make the program easy to use for anyone familiar with the control head of the radio.

This project is in its development phase, so it is not complete.  It is placed on Github for experimenters.  Please do not assume that all will work.

It is written using Visual Studio Community, which can be downloaded for free at:

To connect to the radio, I used a USB to serial converter set to 3 volts:

And a USB to audio interface:

I have included a schematic drawn using ExpressPCB's software.  Connect the radio as shown.  The audio portion is not yet used, and may be added when the software has reached that point.

At this time, only the screen and touch screen emulation are being worked on.  There is no provision for audio yet.

Hopefully, this program will be helpful for experimenters, and if you have additional contributions for the project, please contact me:
